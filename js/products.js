      description: "The one-ounce (1 oz) Gold Maple Leaf Coin is a Canadian coin which has been minted by Royal Canadian Mint since 1979. Therefore, it is one of the oldest gold bullion coins in the world. Next to the Krugerrand, the Maple Leaf gold coin is the most widespread gold coin. \n The front of the coin shows a maple leaf which is also depicted on the national flag of Canada. On the back, like on all coins of the Commonwealth, the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II is visible. Since 2013, the 1 ounce version of the Maple Leaf gold coin bears an additional security feature: a small maple leaf with the last two digits of the year of mint. Inscriptions on the coin are written in the two national Canadian languages, English and French. \n The gold coin is VAT free if the secure storage option with Brink’s is opted for. Storage fee is free for the first 12 months of storage.
